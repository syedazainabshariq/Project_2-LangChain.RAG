# Project_2-LangChain.RAG
I worked on the Project_2-LangChain.RAG, where I explored LangChain's capabilities in building Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. It involved integrating data retrieval with natural language generation to create more efficient and accurate responses. The project was an exciting way to combine search and AI-generated content seamlessly.
